# Password-Based-Circuit-Breaker
Security is the prime concern in our day to day life. Everyone needs to be securing as much as possible. The electric line man safety system is designed to control a circuit breaker by using a password for the safety of line man. Critical electrical accidents to line men are on the rise during electric Line repair due to lack of communication and co-ordination between the maintenance staff and electric substation staff.

 This proposed system provides a solution that ensures safety of maintenance staff, i.e., Line man. The control to turn on or off the line will be maintained by the line man only because this system has an arrangement such that a password is required to operate the circuit breaker (ON/OFF). The system is fully controlled by a microcontroller from ATMEL family. The entered password is compared with the password generated. If the entered password is correct, only then the line can be turned ON/OFF. To repair a particular section of the electric supply line, the lineman wants to turn off the supply to that line. For this he first put a request to the system. Then the system responds to him using the LCD display to enter the password. The password based circuit breaker can also be implemented in automatic door locking system for providing high security, and also can be implemented to control electronic appliances to save the power.
